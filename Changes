  - Add support for cross-database foreign keys (just assert ExtID as usual)
  - Non-InnoDB classes won't try to use InnoDB for their linked tables (oops)
  - Run with hardcoded defaults if .oprc is not found

    values were given for a class
  - OP::Persistence - __selectBool(), __selectSingle() and __selectMulti()
    are now considered public and have been renamed to selectBool(),
    selectSingle() and selectMulti() (old names will work + warn for now)
  - More misc doc updates, tweaks, and fixes

2009-10-01: .317

  - Rewrote tests and added runtime framework loader (OP::Runtime)

    longer exports OP::Subtype constructors
